We've seen that there are certain things that can be implemented to create a more welcoming school environment and a safer-space for minority students (such as people of color, women, disabled people, those in the lgbtqia+ community, etc.). We will work on multiple projects, which will include gathering information and data about a topic of concern (such as the lack of gender neutrality in school, lack of awareness for student of colors issues, etc.) and creating a detailed action plan for making these changes. These projects will hopefully be brought to the attention of the principal and/or assistant principal, so our club can collaborate with them to start making some needed changes on campus.",
